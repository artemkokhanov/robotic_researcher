1. Implement more thorough error handling.
2. Integrate a logging system.
3. Increase code modularity.
4. Improve encoding and decoding for better first paragraph output.
5. Encountering an error message stating "Cloud management controller initialization aborted as CBCM is not enabled." However, the process continues to run smoothly without any major issues.
